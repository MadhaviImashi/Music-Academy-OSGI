# Music-Academy-OSGI
We developed a producer-consumer plugin project using eclipse Equinox OSGI Framework for a
music academy which is a private institute where students can learn music by enrolling in a
preferred course as per their wish. Students can take quizzes (which are added to the system by the
music teachers) prior to enrolment to get a rough idea about the level he/she falls under the chosen
course category (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced). Admin can add musical instrument details and
manage them when needed. Event organizers can create events and cancel scheduled events as
well. Music teachers are responsible for preparing quizzes, updating/deleting questions if needed.
Middle service publisher acts as a common interface for all the publisher services. Altogether 4
consumer bundles and 5 publisher bundles were implemented to cater to this scenario.
The 4 main clients/ consumers who will be using this system for multiple different purposes
associated with the academy are as follows:
- Administrator
- Music teachers
- Students
- Musical event organizers.
